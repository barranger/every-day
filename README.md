# Every Day

Start of a personal website/app to help and track making yourself better one day at a time.  As of Feb 21, there is next to absolutely nothing here outside of a blank Create React App.  Bellow you'll find a todo list that I'll be looking at plugging through, approximately one a day (although some may need to be further broken down.)

## TODO
* Set up the GitHub Pages
* Set up CI/CD for the project
* Create a "Coming Soon" page
* Look at creating a Feed from a selected Reddit Sub Reddit
* Look at adding RSS feeds
* Save config locally
* Allow login via GitHub
* Allow for saving config in the cloud
* Allow for logging out
* Add more TODO's :)
