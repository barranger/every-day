# Every Day

Start of a personal website/app to help and track making yourself better one day at a time.  As of Feb 21, there is next to absolutely nothing here outside of a blank Create React App.  Bellow you'll find a todo list that I'll be looking at plugging through, approximately one a day (although some may need to be further broken down.)
